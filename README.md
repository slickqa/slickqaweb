Slick
=====

Slick is a web based test case and result managment tool.  The previous version 
used java on the server side and jquery / backbone on the web as a single page
web application.

For more information on slick, and applications that integrate with it, take
a look at http://slickqa.com!

This version is being written to use python on the server side (using flask)
and angularjs as the single page web app framework.

If you want to develop it, check out [Developer Setup](https://github.com/slickqa/slickqaweb/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT-SETUP.md).
